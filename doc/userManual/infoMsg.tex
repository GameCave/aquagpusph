\subsubsection{$[$INFO$]$ List too small, local memory usage will be avoided:}
%
When the number of particles is too small, local memory can't be used in the transpose
stage of the Radix sort process (See the chapter \ref{s:aquagpusph}). \NAME will run more slowly
therefore, but since the number of particles is not large probably you must can ignore
this notification.\rc
Sometimes you can try to increase sightly the number of particles in order to recover
the possibility of using local memory, increasing the resolution and the performance.
