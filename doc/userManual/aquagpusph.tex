\section{General}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:general}
%
\NAME functionality can be deeply analyzed using Doxygen documentation. In section \ref{s:install}
you can find how to build Doxygen developers documentation during \NAME compile process. When \NAME
have been already built you can open Doxygen documentation web page with your internet browser,
loading doc/Doxygen/html/index.html web page file.\rc
%
The objective of this chapter is provide some key notes about how \NAME works in order to allow users
understand well what can do or not with this software.\rc
%
In figure \ref{fig:aquagpusph:generalDiagram} you can see the general flux diagram. \NAME is based on a
host-server structure. Host is designed to prepare the case, and to receive and process results, since
server is designed to receive data from server, and compute as many time steps as possible until no new
output is needed.\rc
%
This structure does not only simplify the process and allows more comprehensive code, also is designed
for tolerate several calculation servers working simultaneously on future releases, trying to preserve
the actual simplicity.

\section{Arguments manager}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:argmanager}
%
Arguments manager is the piece of code that analyse input command line options/arguments. You can get a
list of valid options and arguments executing:
%
\begin{verbatim}
AQUAgpusph --help
\end{verbatim}
%
Valid options are:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{-i, -\--input=INPUT}: Set the definition XML file of the simulation.
	\item \textbf{-o, -\--output-prefix=PREFIX}: Set a prefix for output files.
	\item \textbf{-n, -\--no-reassembly}: Visualization output files will not reassembled.
	\item \textbf{-v, -\--version}: Show \NAME version and stop the execution.
	\item \textbf{-h, -\--help}: Show \NAME helps page and stop the execution.
\end{itemize}
%
Options can be freely used simultaneously until incompatibilities are not notified here, or at the help
page. Some combinations of command line options can result on undesired behaviour, like for instance
mixing -\--version with -\--help will discard one of them.\rc
%
In almost cases -\--no-reassembly is a good option, due to reassembly output files can be a really
hard-disk \& CPU consuming process.
%
\section{Problem setup}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:problemsetup}
%
The problem setup stage basically consist on loads all settings established as explained on chapter
\ref{s:caseSetup}, and load the particles/vertexes data from described files on chapter \ref{ss:partsFile}.\rc
%
Problem setup will report work done, and the eventually incidences, on the initialization screen output.
The screen output during initialization and close stages of \NAME execution will be preserved if NCurses
support has been activated, but if NCurses support is not active you can lost the initialization process
reported messages due to the large amount of these printed during the simulation. In this case you
can redirect the screen output to a file typing:
%
\begin{alltt}
AQUAgpusph \emph{COMMANDLINE_OPTIONS} > screen.out
\end{alltt}
%
You can also detach the execution from terminal, for instance using:
%
\begin{alltt}
nohup AQUAgpusph \emph{COMMANDLINE_OPTIONS} > screen.out &
\end{alltt}
%
Allowing you to run \NAME remotely, but in this case you will lost the possibility of stop simulation using `c'
key\footnote{Advanced Linux users can get the process PID and then reinject keys to program}, that as described
on chapter \ref{ss:running:launching} allows you to right stop the simulation closing files.\rc
%
In both cases you will preserve a file called ``screen.out'' that saves the messages reported during
initialization and close stages, and along the simulation as well.

\section{Leap-Frog integration scheme}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:leapfrog}
%
Weakly compressible SPH method is able to return the instantaneous acceleration and density rate for each
particle in a Lagrangian point of view, so 3 variables must be integrated along the time, velocity, position
and density of each particle. \NAME time integration is based on a Leap-Frog predictor-corrector scheme:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Predictor:
	\[
	\dot x_{t+dt}^{\mathrm{pred}} = 
	\dot x_{t} + 
	dt \left(
		\ddot x_{t} + g
	\right)
	\]
	\[
	x_{t+dt}^{\mathrm{pred}} = 
	x_{t} + 
	dt \dot x_{t} + 
	\frac{dt^2}{2} \left(
		\ddot x_{t} + g
	\right)
	\]
	\[
	\rho_{t+dt}^{\mathrm{pred}} = 
	\rho_{t} + 
	dt \dot\rho_{t}
	\]
	\item SPH interactions:
	\[
	\ddot x_{t+dt} \leftarrow \mbox{SPH}
	\]
	\[
	\dot\rho_{t+dt} \leftarrow \mbox{SPH}
	\]
	\item Corrector:
	\[
	\dot x_{t+dt} = 
	\dot x_{t+dt}^{\mathrm{pred}} + 
	\frac{dt}{2} \left(
		\ddot x_{t+dt} - \ddot x_{t}
	\right)
	\]
	\[
	x_{t+dt} = x_{t+dt}^{\mathrm{pred}}
	\]
	\[
	\rho_{t+dt} = 
	\rho_{t+dt}^{\mathrm{pred}} + 
	\frac{dt}{2} \left(
		\dot\rho_{t+dt} - \dot\rho_{t}
	\right)
	\]
\end{enumerate}
%
\section{Link-List}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:linklist}
%
SPH codes commonly uses a PIC (Particle In Cell) based algorithm to easily locate particle's neighbours, called
Link-List. The main difference with typical PIC algorithm is that on SPH a chain is built from the cells data,
linking each particle with the next one on the same cell, allowing that cell only saves the index of the
first particle of the chain.\rc
%
In figure \ref{fig:aquagpusph:LinkList} a simplified scheme of Link-List stored data is shown. Particles are
located in cells that have a length of the maximum interaction distance, then each cell allocates a particle
index called ``head of chain'' (\textit{ihoc}). Each particle stores the next one of the cell chain (\textit{ll})
until last particle is reached, where some invalid index is set  (-1 for instance).\rc
%
In GPU oriented code this behaviour can be conveniently modified looking for sorted memory address reading, that
is really more efficient, sorting particles by cell index. The problem is that traditional method implies storing
Link-List chain, and more over, implies a chaotic memory access at particles interaction stage, with a heavy
performance penalty. So, as many other GPU based SPH codes, \NAME sorts the particles, transforming the Link-List
array ll[\textit{i}] in \textit{i}+1 variables, so is not anymore needed to store it therefore.\rc
%

\end{figure}
%
\section{Particles interactions}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:rates}
%
Particles interactions is the core of every SPH method, and is the most complex stage too, being the most
time consuming one. \NAME can perform several particles interaction stages by time step depending on simulation
settings, for instance, if `DeLeffe' boundary condition is set at least 3 interactions stages will be performed,
the usual one, the boundary integrals, and `ElasticBounce' non wall trespassing condition, but since only the usual one
needs to compute all possible particles interactions, the others may take less time.\rc
%
As explained in section \ref{ss:aquagpusph:linklist}, the particles interactions computation performance is
heavily dependant on Link-List stage and \NAME performs a particles sorting based on cell as many other GPU
oriented SPH codes, but two main differences must be remarked:
%
\subsection{Unsorted output arguments}
%
In section \ref{ss:aquagpusph:leapfrog} time integration scheme is described, and we can find that after predictor
stage, variables $\dot x_{t}$, $\mathbf{x}_{t}$, and $\rho_{t}$ are not needed anymore until new time step,
so \NAME can use these arrays in order to store sorted data for SPH interactions stage, decreasing memory
requirements, but the same process can not be applied to output data $\ddot x_{t}$ and $\dot\rho_{t}$,
because is needed on corrector stage, so there are 2 ways to solve it:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create new arrays for the sorted output data, working all time in sorted space.
	\item Work on sorted space, but write at unsorted space.
\end{enumerate}
%
\NAME use the second way, that have some significant advantages:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Less memory requirements that the first way.
	\item Since \NAME is using non needed arrays to store the sorted input data, the unsorted data is preserved.
	\item Since the output data is written on unsorted space directly, after SPH interactions stage all the
	unsorted data is available to continue working, including to print output files (Note that the unsorted space
	is the original one).
	\item No unsort operation is required.
\end{enumerate}
%
Of course, write into the unsorted space at the interactions stage can be more expensive, but since the writing
operations are really less frequent than the reading ones, performance decrease can be assumed.
%
\subsection{Coalescence read}
%
Newest hardware not suffers really heavy penalties when a lot of threads try to read from the same memory address,
nevertheless \NAME incorporates an algorithm in order to reduce as much as possible the number of readers over
unique address. In figure \ref{fig:aquagpusph:CoalescenceRead} a scheme about the interactions process is shown.
Interactions stage is divided in 3 substages:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interacts with next particles of the home cell\footnote{Home cell is the cell where the computing
	particle is located} chain.
	\item Interacts with the particles on the neighbour cells.
	\item Interacts with previous particles of the home cell chain.
\end{enumerate}
%
As you can see in figure \ref{fig:aquagpusph:CoalescenceRead} the particles does not reads from the same memory
address in any interactions. In practice, due to the particles interactions can take different times, due to the
neighbour cells particles can try to read from same memory address, several simultaneous reads can happens, but
in much less number.

\section{Boundary conditions}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:boundaries}
%
\subsection{General}
%
\NAME provides most commonly used boundary conditions in order to allow users to can choose the one than better fit
to their problem. The generally suggested method is Boundary integrals (formerly `DeLeffe') that is flexible and
powerful, but have the disadvantage that requires `Shepard' correction for consistency.\rc
%
Along this chapter all boundary conditions will be described, and advantages discussed. Also the mixing possibilities
will be introduced.

\section{Motions}
\label{ss:aquagpusph:motions}
%
\subsection{General}
%
In \NAME the motions imposed externally can be classified in 2 ways, by the method to impose the motion, and
by the method to compute the motion data. In table \ref{tables:aquagpusph:motions} all the available motions
in \NAME are listed, with their classification.\rc
%
Along this section all the different motion types, and control methods will be described. You can go to the
chapter \ref{s:examples} to see practical applications of some number of available motions.
