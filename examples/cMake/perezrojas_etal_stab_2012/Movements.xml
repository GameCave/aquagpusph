        <!-- Add motions. Several motions can be added, and effects will be
        superposed.
        type="LIQuaternion": Quaternion (described by axis) will be provided
        in a file for several time instants, and the value at each time step
        will be lineary interpolated
        type="C1Quaternion": Quaternion (described by axis) will be provided
        in a file for several time instants, and the value at each time step
        will be interpolated through C1 polynomial functions.
        type="ScriptQuaternion": Python script will control the position of
        the quaternion at each time step.
