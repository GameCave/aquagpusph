        <!-- Number of steps between LinkList perform.
        LinkList is a relative complex operation, so decreasing the times
        that this operation is performed, some speed-ups can be won. On the
        other hand, increasing this value the cells size is increased as well,
        so more neighbours will be artificially and unnecessary considered per
        each particle, which may result in some performance lost.
        If the velocity changes too fast using this trick may imply some
        errors, so it is strongly recommended to let the value 1 if you don't
        know what are you doing.

        Density field interpolation reinitializates the density field
        interpolating it instead of using the continuity equation, resulting in
        smooth fields.
        Let it disabled if you dont know what are you doing.

        The distance is provided as a kernel height rate. 0.0 can be applied

            value="ForceDens": Force and density rate will be renormalized.
        Renormalization can result in some instabilities. On the other hand
        when DeLeffe boundary condition is applied the formulation requires it.
