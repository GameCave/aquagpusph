		<!-- Gamma of fluid. Gamma is the exponent of Batchelor-67 state equation. -->
		<Option name="gamma" value="1.0" />
		<!-- Gravity force vector [m/s2] -->
		<Option name="g" x="0.0" y="-9.81" />
		<!-- Kernel height multiplier. Kernel height will be calculated as hfac times deltar,
		 and specify the number of neighbour particles. -->
		<Option name="hfac" value="4.0" />
		<!-- Distance between particles. If variable maximum value is suggested, but small
		 variation are not relevant. -->
		<Option name="deltar" x="0.000578778" y="0.000578778" />  
		<!-- Sound speed of fluid. Take care when you change this value if you are loading
		 fluid from file, because the density field must be corrected too. -->
		<Option name="cs" value="45.0" />
		<!-- Time step divisor. Time step is calculated every time, and clamped to be lower than
		 a maximum value, but the time step resultant is divided by this factor, that can help
		 to solve some instabilities improving the Courant number. -->
		<Option name="DivDt" value="4.0" />
		<!-- Number of steps between LinkList perform [int].
		  LinkList is a relative complex operation, so decreasing the times that this operation is
		  performed, some speed-ups can taken. At the other hand, increasing this value cells size
		  is increased, reverting in a dramatic increase of particles neighbours, increasing the time
		  spent in rates calculation.
		  Depending the number of neighbours (deltar & hfac) and DivDt, the best value can vary.
		  -->
		<Option name="LLSteps" value="1" />
		<!-- Number of steps before density field interpolation [int].
		  Density field interpolation reinitializates the density field interpolating it (and discarding
		  evolution data). This operation can restore smooth density fields. If 0 value set, density
		  interpolation will not performed.
		  -->
		<Option name="DensSteps" value="0" />
		<!-- Boundary condition employed:
		  value="ElasticBounce": Elastic bounce will considered on walls. An elastic factor is applied too. This
		  method is used internally on FixParticles and DeLeffe boundaries.
		  value="FixParticles" (default value): A set of particles (several rows) must be placed at boundary as
		  extension of the fluid (U0Model).
		  value="DeLeffe": Boundary integrals will used at boundary.
		  -->
		<Option name="Boundary" value="ElasticBounce" />
		<!-- Walls slip condition:
		  * NoSlip: Zero tangencial velocity is imposed at wall.
		  * FreeSlip: Only normal velocity is imposed at wall.
		  -->
		<Option name="SlipCondition" value="FreeSlip" />
		<!-- Distance to the wall where elastic shock is applied.
		  @note Distance is provided as kernel height rate.
		  @warning Ussually 0.1 (default value) is a good value, but depending the problem, kernel height,
		  time step, and others, this value must be increased. It's strongly recommended don't use high
		  values or undessireable fluid reactions may happens, try to change csmin or hfac before.
		  -->
		<Option name="BoundDist" value="0.1" />
		<!-- Elastic factor at boundary. 0.0 for total energy dissipation, 1.0 for fully conservative
		 reaction on wall.
		 -->
		<Option name="BoundElasticFactor" value="0.0" />
		<!-- Environment where renormalization (formerly Shepard correction) must be applied.
		 value="None": Shepard correction will not be applied.
		 value="Force": Computed force over particles will be renormalized.
		 value="Dens": Density rate computed will be renormalized.
		 value="ForceDens": Force and density rate will be renormalized.
		 Renormalization can result in some instabilities. At the other hand DeLeffe formulation requires
		 Shepard correction, so Force is suggested if you use DeLeffe boundary condition.
		 -->
		<Option name="Shepard" value="None" />
		<!-- Domain bounds. Optionally you can add domain bounds in order to fix particles that go out. If
		  you don't add this option, particles can go as far as possible, that in case of wall penetration
		  can cause program crash.
		  @note Ussually is a good idea has a domain bounds.
		  @warning In 2D h is associated to y coordinate, but in 3D h is associated to z, and new d dimensions
		  is associated to y coordiante.
