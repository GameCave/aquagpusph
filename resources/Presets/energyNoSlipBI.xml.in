<!-- energyNoSlipBI.xml
Boundary integrals are set as free slip by default, but noslip can be activated
with the preset noSlipBI.xml. In such case, the energy exchanged with the
boundary should be computed as well, which can be done with this preset.

You just need to include it, and define which particles set will be affected
setting the variable noslip_iset (0 by default).

If several boundaries, belonging to different particles sets, should be no-slip
enforced, then include this preset several times, and reevaluate the affected
noslip_iset variable each time, for instance:
<Include file="energyNoSlipBI.xml" prefix="iset0_"/>
<Include file="energyNoSlipBI.xml" prefix="iset2_"/>
<Tools>
    <Tool action="insert" before="iset0_EnergyViscNoSlipBI" type="set_scalar" name="noslip_iset0" in="noslip_iset" value="0"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="iset2_EnergyViscNoSlipBI" type="set_scalar" name="noslip_iset2" in="noslip_iset" value="2"/>
</Tools>

This preset should be included after noSlipBI.xml and energy.xml
