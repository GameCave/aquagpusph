<!-- BIFree.xml
Define a boundary which its stress is imposed by the user, as a pressure field.
In this case the boundary motion results from the momentum equation solution.

You just need to include it, and define which particles set will be affected
setting the variable BIfree_iset (0 by default).

To use this preset, BI.xml should be included first.

If several boundaries, belonging to different particles sets, are considered
as free motion ones, then include this preset several times, and reevaluate the
affected BIfree_iset variable each time, for instance:

<Include file="BIFree.xml" prefix="iset0_"/>
<Include file="BIFree.xml" prefix="iset2_"/>
<Tools>
    <Tool action="insert" before="iset0_lela BI Free" type="set_scalar" name="BIfree_iset0" in="BIfree_iset" value="0"/>
    <Tool action="insert" before="iset2_lela BI Free" type="set_scalar" name="BIfree_iset2" in="BIfree_iset" value="2"/>
</Tools>
