/** \mainpage AQUAgpusph (Another QUAlity GPU-SPH).
 * Free CFD code based on SPH (Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics), licensed
 * under GPLv3 terms, for details read provided LICENSE file (SPH is a
 * meshfree Lagrangian method to solve Navier-Stokes equations). \n
 * AQUAgpusph is based on the weakly compressible SPH branch (formerly W-SPH or
 * WCSPH), where the pressure field is linked with the density one by a
 * equation of state (EOS).
 * Ussually the EOS is applied: \n
 * \f$ p = \frac{c_S^2 \rho_0}{\gamma} \left( \left( \frac{\rho}{\rho_0} \right)^{\gamma} - 1 \right) , \f$ \n
 * where \f$ \gamma = 7 \f$ is usually set for water. \n
 * AQUAgpusph has been has been accelerated with OpenCL allowing you to execute
 * it over CPU or GPU based platforms, or eventually, using every platform
 * developed on future conveniently adapted to the OpenCL standard.
 * For the moment several platforms usage simultaneously is not supported. \n
 * In order to learn how to use AQUAgpusph an user manual and some examples are provided. \n
 * AQUAgpusph has been developed by CEHINAV group: \n
 * <ul><li>Jose Luis Cercos Pita</li>
 * <li>Antonio Souto Iglesias</li>
 * <li>Leo Miguel Gonzalez</li></ul>
 * First release of the code have been published at Wed. 2013-12-12. \n
